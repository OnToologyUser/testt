# BMOO ( Building Maintenance Operations Ontology)
This project aims to develop a domain ontology for the representation of building maintenance data. The ontology combines several resources, including a general maintenance ontology (Maintenance Reference Ontology), an ontology of assets within buildings (Brick), and a semantic modeling of building maintenance processes (in collaboration with Intent Technologies).
