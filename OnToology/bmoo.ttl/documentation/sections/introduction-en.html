  The real estate sector plays a crucial role in the economy. As a result, the building and real estate market is currently 
  undergoing a major digital transformation, with the emergence of several standards for data exchange, whether in the construction phase or in the management and operation of buildings. 
  Concerning the construction phase, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is one of the most widely adopted solutions. For the operation phase and maintenance of buildings, there is no real emerging standard. 
  BM2O is an initiative aimed at promoting a domain ontology for the representation of building maintenance data. BM2O combines a general maintenance ontology (Maintenance Reference Ontology), 
  an ontology of assets within buildings (Brick), and a semantic modeling of building maintenance processes (in collaboration with Intent Technologies)

  <ul>
  <li><b>Maintenance Reference Ontology</b>: is a minimal ontology aligned to IOF CORE and by extension BFO. It deliberately captures only concepts frequently captured in data in the maintenance phase of the asset life cycle.</li>  
  
    <li><b>Brick</b>: is an open-source effort to standardize semantic descriptions of the physical, logical and virtual assets in buildings and the relationships between them. Brick consists of an extensible dictionary of terms and concepts in and around buildings, a set of relationships for linking and composing concepts together.</li>
  
    <li><b>Intent Technologie</b>: Company/digital solution aimed at promoting a software solution for the collection, aggregation, and sharing of information among key stakeholders in the real estate profession, such as service providers, properties managers, ...etc.</li>
  </ul>
